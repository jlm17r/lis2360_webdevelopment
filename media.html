    <h3><em>Signs  you're being Catfished</em></h3>


    <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        
        <td><b>They do not have enough information online</b></td>
        <td>This is a big sign that a person is a catfish, as it can be easily identified if the person does not have enough information on their social media. This may also mean that the person does not often interact with their friends online, as they do not have enough information to share. </td>
      </tr>
      
       <tr>
        <td><b>They do not want to meet in person</b></td>
        <td>This is one of the biggest signs if the catfisher does not want to meet as it is going to reveal that they are not who they present themselves on social media. At times, they will pretend that they are willing to meet, and would later back out and give an excuse to the person they are catfishing. </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td><b>They do not want to video chat</b></td>
        <td>One of the many excuses that catfishers use when they do not want to video chat is that their phone cameras do not work, or that they are busy. </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td><b>They do not have many friends on their social media</b></td>
        <td>It is difficult for catfishers to often get friends on social media, as people will not befriend or follow them if they do not personally know the person. </td>
      </tr>
